  Abstract                 = {Packrat Parsing is a technique for implementing backtracking, recursive-descent parsers, with the
advantage that it guarantees unlimited lookahead and a linear parse time. Using this technique,
one can design parsers that can accept left recursive grammars, thereby drastically expanding
the class of grammars that can be accepted by such parsers. The goal of this project was to
integrate such techniques on top of the Scala parser-combinator library, with the main objective
being seamless integration into the library, and retaining the same ease of use as the original library.},

terms which can be included in the function solely for the designer's convenience.},
